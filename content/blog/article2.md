# Why I Love Ned Stark

On April 17, 2011, a fantasy drama TV show that would become a worldwide phenomenon aired. That show was Game of Thrones, and that day, the world met Ned Stark, played by Sean Bean. This article will be exclusively using the TV show, as I have not read the novels, but there is no doubt some crossover between them. This article is not trying to defend all of his actions; rather, it is just me talking about attributes of this character that I like. That being said, I love Ned Stark because he is a great father, he has a strong sense of duty, and he is just a good man overall. 

## Ned the Father

Ned is a father of six children, the lord of Winterfell, and also the Hand of the King in possibly the most dangerous place for him to live in the world of Game of Thrones, King’s Landing. Ned does not get many interactions with his kids because of how busy his life is, but from what the show provides, Ned is depicted as a loving father trying his best in a treacherous world. It goes from day-to-day life problems like Sansa and Arya fighting, and him trying to play mediator, albeit half successfully: fumbling by giving Sansa toys she’s too old for, but on the good side, getting Arya a sword and swordmaster to her joy. It goes further to bigger things, like when Jon Snow leaves to join the Night’s Watch. Jon, a bastard, is unconfident in his relationship with his father, but Ned reassures him by saying, “You may not have my name, but you have my blood.” It’s moments like these, and there are many more, where Ned is able to show how much his family means to him because they are what motivates him to make the decisions that he makes throughout his time on the show. His lasting impacts are also best seen in his children, who go on to become great people and who go to great lengths to bring honor to their family’s name. 

## Lord of Winterfell

Ned’s first scene in the show is him confronting a deserter who had encountered a terrifying creature called a White Walker, something the other characters do not believe in at this point in the show. The young man and Ned have a solemn understanding that Ned has to kill him as the crowd watches onward, and so he does. These are the moments that some people question, and I can understand that; However, one also cannot help but to have some level of respect for him standing up for the law above his own personal beliefs. To elaborate, throughout the show, Ned is forced into making difficult decisions, but for the most part, he tries to detach himself from the situation and take an objective stance that upholds the law laid out before him, as is his duty as lord. This does have to come with the acknowledgement of how imperfect this path is, which is best seen in the scene where Ned leaves for King’s Landing. His wife reminds him of how last time he left, he returned home with “another woman’s child” (Jon Snow). She says the lines, “You do have a choice, and you’ve made it.” This is likely why Ned is eventually forced to take more moral stances (although he is also in a place of more power when he begins taking these stances). 

## Eddard Stark

Ned’s changes throughout the story humanize him more as he becomes less of a man driven by law and more of a man who is trying to advocate for goodness in a world of deceit and wrath. One of the best examples of this is when he refuses to sanction the assassination of Daenerys Targaryen, the only surviving member of the only family that can control dragons, after discovering she is pregnant. King Robert and Ned fight and actually argue over it as Robert fears the potential danger she poses, while Ned refuses to kill a pregnant woman who poses no immediate threat. Ned resigns after their fight, and although he and Robert eventually make up, it is a huge moment for Ned to stand up to the King in a room of powerful people because of what he believes in. Similarly, he falls on the sword when Robert dies, and he is captured by the Lannisters. He makes a fake confession to save his daughters because he cares about them more than his own status and life. As the authority of the story continues to get corrupted, Ned has to stick to his guns more and more, and I cannot help but have the utmost admiration for that. 

## Conclusion

It is a monumental feat that a character is able to leave such a lasting impression on an audience after appearing in only one season of television. Ned was one of the most morally upstanding characters in the show, and his lasting effect on the show is obvious in his children, who carry his values onward. No, Ned Stark is not a perfect man, but that’s what makes him so great. The fact that he is trying to do what he thinks is the right thing to do at all times is what makes him good. He weighs situations and tries to avoid compromising his values whenever he can, especially as a man who has made mistakes in his past. It’s so inspiring seeing a figure who stands for what he believes in a world of revenge, assassinations, and war.
