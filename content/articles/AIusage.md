The main use of AI for this website was with the movie recommendation generator. AI helped me get a basis for a lot of commands that I was not aware, and expanded on the base that I built using previous assignments like the bhangra table randomizer. 

These commands mainly involved those to get the checkboxes working. AI primarily helped with getting the filter system set up because I was going in the completely wrong direction with the coding.
