## The Medieval Practice of "Bugonia"

<img class="image-center-250" src="/bugonia0.jpg">

In the period between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, there was a practice performed by apiarists known as “bugonia”. Bugonia is a gruesome process where men will beat an ox almost to death (careful not to spill any blood) before leaving it in an enclosed shelter for weeks with the hope of bees spawning from its corpse. Historians to this day debate on where this belief could have possibly come from, and recently it has breached the popular discussion after the release of the 2025 film of the same name, *Bugonia*. *Bugonia* is a movie about a pharmaceutical CEO who is kidnapped by conspiracy theorists who believe that she is secretly an alien sent to destroy humanity. Although the movie and the practice seem like totally different ideas, the movie actually follows the ritual of bugonia using a bait-and-switch. *Bugonia* is able to represent its practice of the same name through its use of apiarists, sacrificial lambs (oxen), and the eventual return of the bees in the film’s final moments. 

## *Bugonia*(2025)

On the surface, it seems obvious that Teddy, the conspiracy-driven beekeeper, would represent the apiarists who practised bugonia. It’s true that Teddy literally owns bees, but he's also actively seeking to bring them back in a larger sense. At the beginning of the film, Teddy monologues about the beauty and fragility of bees, and how they are dying out now because of a shadow government conspiracy to control supply chains. In this sense, it is also clear to see how Teddy can represent the blind nature of the bugonian apiarists who believed in a myth that the ox’s death would bring them more bees. It is also true that Teddy spends the majority of the film beating Michelle in various ways, much like the apiarists brutally beat the ox, and, like them, Teddy never beats her so badly that she dies. It is reasonable to believe that Teddy is meant to represent the apiarist with all of this in mind.

Following this logic, Michelle must then be the ox as she is the subject of all of Teddy’s beatings. She is powerless throughout most of the film to Teddy’s beatings, but the distinct difference is Michelle’s ability to speak. Michelle is a practical, cool-headed, and convincing orator who is constantly able to talk Teddy down from going completely over the edge, <span class = 'hidden-text'>*although it takes her a long time to eventually convince him to let her go.*</span> Michelle cannot be the ox because even though she is stuck in her situation, she is still an active and powerful presence that is consistently able to keep herself alive. In this way, Michelle is more comparable to the bees, whom she and Teddy can mutually agree are resilient. However, the idea that Teddy is the apiarist and Michelle is the ox or even the bees just falls apart when following that line of logic. 

<b>HEAVY SPOILERS AHEAD</b>

<span class = 'hidden-text'>*I believe that if the Bugonia movie follows the same steps as the bugonia ritual, then Michelle would be the actual apiarist. Michelle reveals at the end of the movie that she really is an alien, but Teddy had it backwards: the aliens were the ones trying to save Earth (and humanity itself) from humanity. When Michelle realises how monstrous Teddy is, she makes him accidentally kill his own mother. There are a handful of other deaths in the film as well, but it seems like Teddy’s mother could be the real ox as she is immobile and, in a metaphorical sense, has been beaten down by the healthcare system. Her death lets Michelle finally convince Teddy to let her out. When Michelle is freed, she kills humanity, and the movie ends with a sequence of animals, including bees, living in a world now occupied only by human corpses. In this sense, the bees are able to come back because Michelle killed humanity, which completes the puzzle of lining up the movie with the bugonia ritual.*</span>


## Conclusion
*Bugonia* makes a point about humanity’s inclinations to superstition and conspiracy. Even though Teddy <span class = 'hidden-text'>*is correct about the aliens’ existence (unlike the apiarists who worked purely off belief)*</span>, he is still blinded by his own hubris and incidentally ends up getting a lot of innocent people killed along his journey. Michelle and Teddy share the same idyllic goal of saving the planet and saving humanity, but Teddy’s disconnect and rage make him believe that the only way to achieve his goals is through violence. Much like the people of the late Middle Ages who practised brutalising oxen to hopefully bring them more bees, Teddy is so confident in what he believes that he will follow it no matter what anyone else says. *Bugonia* seems to suggest that the existence of bugonia, people like Teddy, and the overwhelming power of corporations are just some examples of how humans are innately animalistic, and our only option is to grow or die.
