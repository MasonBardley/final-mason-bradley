<b>Pictures</b>

The website banner was made using Canva, and is consistent through every page. 

Pictures have been added for visual appeal to different pages. I attempted to make it so the images would be able to appear in different places, but I did not get that accomplished. 

<b>Hidden Text for Spoilers</b>

I was looking for ways to hide text, and I found a reddit post that contained the code for hiding text as seen in the "Bugonia" article, and used it for covering up spoilers unless someone desired to look at it by hovering their mouse over the text. 

This is accomplished by making a class called 'hidden-text' that will set the opacity of a given piece of text to 0. 'hidden-text:hover' returns the text's opacity to 1 when the mouse is hovering over top of it.
