<b>Pictures</b>

The website banner was made using Canva, and is consistent through every page. 

Pictures have been added for visual appeal to different pages. I attempted to make it so the images would be able to appear in different places, but I did not get that accomplished. I pulled the code from Dr. White's github. 

<b>Hidden Text for Spoilers</b>

I wanted to hide the text from people who did not want to be spoiled, so I found a piece of code on reddit that turned the text's opacity to 0, but I adjusted the code to make black bars instead. This is done by turning the text and background to the same color: black. 

I also added a hover feature where the blacked-out text loses its black background when a mouse hovers over it. 

<b>Movie Recommender</b>

I was looking for a substantive enhancement to make to my website, and I had an idea to create a generator that would recommend movies if you needed an idea for something to watch one night. 

The generator was made using the code from the bhangra randomizer as a base, and AI was used to expand from there with a lot of the commands that I did not know how to use such as making the filter tool and creating the checkboxes. 

I manually put together the list of movie possibilities with genre and year. I also worked a lot with the formatting to make the generator look neat.
