<b>Pictures</b>

The website banner was made using Canva, and is consistent through every page. 

Pictures have been added for visual appeal to different pages. I attempted to make it so the images would be able to appear in different places, but I did not get that accomplished. I pulled the code from Dr. White's github. 

<b>Hidden Text for Spoilers</b>

I wanted to hide the text from people who did not want to be spoiled, so I found a piece of code on reddit that turned the text's opacity to 0, but I adjusted the code to make black bars instead. This is done by turning the text and background to the same color: black. 

I also added a hover feature where the blacked-out text loses its black background when a mouse hovers over it.
