I lived in Lexington, KY for the first 10 years of my life before moving to Georgetown, KY. I've lived here for the rest of my life. 

## Work
The vast majority of my work experience is in fast food. I've worked almost a month at Bojangles, over two years at Zaxby's, and then over 6 months at Popeye's. After that, I decided that I was done with fast food (and chicken), and I wanted to just enjoy the rest of my college life. 

## College
I'm pursuing an English degree with a minor in Computer Sciences. I'm a member of and the Vice President of the President's House Association where I've found a sense of comradery in brotherhood and gained a lot of experience in a leadership position as well as other positions I held in the house. This includes graphics chair, membership chair, community relations chair, and t-shirt chair. 

## Passions
I am passionate about the craft of writing, and I would like to be able to pursue it as a career one day. I also like to run long distance, although I hurt my leg very recently and have been able to do any running. Naturally, I also have a deep respect for art, primarily in film and television as I would like to pursue a career involved in entertainment.
