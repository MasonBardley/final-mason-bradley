I grew up in Lexington, KY where I spent the first 10 years of my life. I moved to Georgetown, KY, and have lived here for the rest of my life. I'm pursuing an English degree with a minor in Computer Sciences. I love watching all types of movies and TV shows, but comedies especially. I am also a fan of old musicians such as Sam Cooke, Bobby Darin, and Elvis.
