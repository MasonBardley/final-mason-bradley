## Early Years

I grew up in Lexington, KY where I spent the first 10 years of my life. I was an only child, and had an interest in art and writing from an early age. My parents pushed me to join a lot of clubs and various activities to help grow my social skills and to develop the spectrum of interests that I had. 

## College

I came to college planning on being an IT major, but I quickly realized that I was much more interested in writing. I decided that no matter what, I wanted to pursue my passion for the craft. 

## Goals

I plan on getting involved in various local film production companies to get my start in a film career. However, any field where I can express creativity and be apart of large projects would keep me satisifed.
